The calculator project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional digital calculator. HTML provides the structure, defining elements like buttons and display areas. CSS styles the calculator, ensuring it's visually appealing and responsive. JavaScript adds interactivity, handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display accordingly. Together, these technologies form a cohesive project that enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations conveniently within a web browser.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML: HTML will define the structure of your calculator, including the layout of buttons, input fields, and any other necessary elements. You'll use various HTML elements like <div>, <button>, and <input> to create the visual interface.

- CSS: CSS will be used to style your calculator, making it visually appealing and ensuring it's responsive and user-friendly. You can use CSS to define the colors, fonts, sizes, and layout of your calculator elements to match your design preferences.

- JavaScript: JavaScript will provide the functionality for your calculator. You'll write JavaScript code to handle user input (button clicks), perform calculations based on the input, and update the display accordingly. This includes handling arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as implementing other features like clearing the display or handling decimal points.
