# Landing-Page-CODSOFT

This project involves creating a responsive landing page using HTML and CSS for the structure and styling, with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for animations. The HTML provides a semantic structure for the content, while CSS ensures a visually appealing and adaptive layout across different devices. GSAP adds dynamic, smooth animations to enhance user engagement and interaction, creating a visually compelling experience that guides visitors through the landing page elements effectively.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML: For structuring the content and layout of the website.
- CSS: For styling and designing the visual aspects of the website, including layouts, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and dynamic functionality and animations to the website, such as scrolling and loading animations.
